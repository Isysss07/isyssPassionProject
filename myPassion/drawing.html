        <h1> How Drawing Impacted My Life</h1>
        <p> My passion is drawing. I love to draw because it's an acessable way for me to express myself or just have fun. I believe anyone can draw if they put the time and effort in. The idea of puting a pen to paper and making something extrodinary is absolutely thrilling. I draw almost everyday. It has become my favorite thing to do in life. Making art is one of the most amazing things that anyone can do. </p>
        <p> Drawing may not be easy or fun at first, but with practice your art will be stunning. Anyone can draw with enough dedication. The best artists did't just wake up ad become great, they had to work had to better their skills.So if you put your mind to it you may just become one of the best. If youre not sure where to start then click the links at the bottom of the page. I hope to se you there.</p>
        <p> I can't really remeber what introduced me to drawing, or how it was done. It has become an everday practice. It's just habit to pick up a pen and create something new. Maybe it was one of my teachers telling me to draw a barnyard animal. However it happened I'm glad it did. Now I can create art and hopefull inspire you to do the same</p>
        <p> The person who inspired me to draw was one of my friends. Her drawings were amazing. She isn't a huge artsist, but she helped me find my passion. You dont need a celeberity to inspire you sometimes it could be someone you know. Isporation comes from everywhere. You jut have to be willing to look. Who knows, maybe your inporation could come from a friend too.</p>
        <p> I inspire myslef to keep drawing. I want to get better. I love watching myself grow and become better. Drawing is a great way to show my growth. I'm proud of how far I've come.  </p>
